# Rewrite Columns

## Step 4.1: Rewrite the column value(Formal_education) into readable values
```{r}
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Bachelorâ€™s degree (BA, BS, B.Eng., etc.)"] <- "Bachelors"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education ==  "Associate degree"] <- "Associates"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Some college/university study without earning a degree" ] <- "Some college/university"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Masterâ€™s degree (MA, MS, M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"] <- "Masters"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.)" ] <- "Secondary school"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.)"] <- "Professional degree"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "Other doctoral degree (Ph.D, Ed.D., etc.)"] <- "Others"
renamed_public$formal_education[renamed_public$formal_education == "I never completed any formal education"  ] <- "None"
```

## Step 4.2: Rewrite survey_too_long into readable values
```{r}
renamed_public$survey_too_long[renamed_public$survey_too_long == "The survey was an appropriate length"] <- "Appropriate length"
renamed_public$survey_too_long[renamed_public$survey_too_long == "The survey was too long"] <- "Too long"
renamed_public$survey_too_long[renamed_public$survey_too_long == "The survey was too short"] <- "Too short"
```

## Step 4.3: Rewrite education_parents
```{r}
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Bachelor's degree (BA, BS, B.Eng., etc.)"] <- "Bachelors"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Some college/university study without earning a degree" ] <- "Some college/university"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.)"] <- "Secondary school"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Master's degree (MA, MS, M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"] <- "Masters"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.)"] <- "Professional degree"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Other doctoral degree (Ph.D, Ed.D., etc.)"] <- "Other"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "They never completed any formal education"] <- "None"

renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Bachelorâ€™s degree (BA, BS, B.Eng., etc.)"] <- "Bachelors"
renamed_public$education_parents[renamed_public$education_parents == "Masterâ€™s degree (MA, MS, M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"] <- "Masters"

```

## Step 4.4: Rewrite job_search_status
```{r}
#unique(renamed_public$job_search_status)
renamed_public$job_search_status[renamed_public$job_search_status ==  "Iâ€™m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities"] <- "Not actively looking"
renamed_public$job_search_status[renamed_public$job_search_status ==  "I am actively looking for a job"] <- "Actively looking"
renamed_public$job_search_status[renamed_public$job_search_status ==  "I am not interested in new job opportunities"] <- "Neither"
#unique(renamed_public$job_search_status)
```

## Step 4.5: Rewrite hope_five_years
```{r}
renamed_public$hope_five_years[renamed_public$hope_five_years ==  "Working as a founder or co-founder of my own company"] <- "Founder or co-founder"
renamed_public$hope_five_years[renamed_public$hope_five_years ==  "Working in a different or more specialized technical role than the one I'm in now"] <- "Different or specialized technical role"
renamed_public$hope_five_years[renamed_public$hope_five_years ==  "Working as an engineering manager or other functional manager"] <- "Engineering or other functional manager"
renamed_public$hope_five_years[renamed_public$hope_five_years ==  "Working in a career completely unrelated to software development"] <- "Career unrelated to software development"
renamed_public$hope_five_years[renamed_public$hope_five_years ==  "Working as a product manager or project manager"] <- "Product or project manager"
```

## Step 4.6: Rewrite survey_easy
```{r}
#unique(renamed_public$survey_easy)
renamed_public$survey_easy[renamed_public$survey_easy == "Neither easy nor difficult"] <- "Neither"
#unique(renamed_public$survey_easy)
```

## Step 5: Drop column "militrary_US"
```{r}
#Insert code here
public_cleaned <- select(renamed_public, -military_US)
#head(public_data)
```

```{r}
#public_data
```

# Example Visualizations

```{r}
